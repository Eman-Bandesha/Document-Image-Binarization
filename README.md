# Document-Image-Binarization
This repository contains code for document image binarization with the implementation of Otsu, Sauvola, and Adaptive Gaussian Filtering algorithms. The evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance include Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Dynamic Range Decrease (DRD), Intersection over Union (IOU), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
